# Why I changed my GitHub username (and how you can protect yours) üîí

## Why I made the change ü§î

One day, I noticed something odd someone was using my username (or similar variations of it) on other platforms. While I‚Äôm not famous or widely followed, this impersonation raised some concerns:
- It could confuse collaborators or followers who think the impersonator is me.
- It might damage my reputation if the impersonator acts maliciously.
- It made me realize the importance of securing my online identity.

To avoid any confusion, I decided to change my GitHub username to something more unique and harder to mimic. I also want to take this opportunity to clarify an important point:

## A quick note about social networks üåê

I‚Äôm no longer active on any social networks except for GitHub. If you see someone using my name or an old username on platforms like Twitter or Instagram, it‚Äôs **not me**. Always double-check by visiting my official GitHub profile or other verified links.

## How to check if someone is impersonating you üõ°Ô∏è

If you‚Äôre wondering whether someone is pretending to be you, here‚Äôs how you can check:

### 1. Search your username online
Use search engines like Google or DuckDuckGo to look for your username and its variations:
- `"your_username" site:twitter.com`
- `"your_username"` or `"your-username"`

This can help you find any unfamiliar accounts or suspicious activity.

### 2. Check common platforms
Search for your username on platforms where impersonation often happens, such as:
- GitHub
- Twitter
- Instagram
- LinkedIn
- Stack Overflow
- Discord

Most platforms have search bars or directories to help you locate accounts using your name.

### 3. Use monitoring tools
You can automate the search process with tools like:
- **[Namechk](https://namechk.com/)**: Check where your username is already taken or used.
- **[Google Alerts](https://www.google.com/alerts)**: Set up alerts for your username to get notified when it appears online.
- **[KnowEm](https://knowem.com/)**: Track your username across various platforms.

### 4. Make it a habit to check
It‚Äôs a good idea to periodically search for your username and variations. Regular checks ensure you can catch impersonation early before it becomes a bigger issue.

## What to do if you‚Äôre impersonated üö®

If you discover someone is impersonating you, follow these steps:

1. **Report the account**  
   Most platforms have impersonation reporting features. Provide evidence, such as links to your active accounts or original content, to prove your identity.

2. **Secure variations of your username**  
   If your preferred username is already taken, claim similar ones that are recognizable (e.g., `yourusername_dev` or `yourusername_codes`).

3. **Let people know**  
   Use your verified accounts to inform your audience or collaborators about the impersonation. Share links to your official profiles to avoid confusion.

## Why it‚Äôs important to stay vigilant üëÄ

Even if you don‚Äôt have a large following, impersonation can still happen. Here‚Äôs why it matters:
- **Confusion**: People might mistake the impersonator for you.
- **Reputation risk**: Impersonators could scam or mislead others using your name.
- **Missed opportunities**: Someone else might claim your preferred username on new platforms.

## How to secure your accounts üîí

Here are some simple but effective steps to keep your accounts safe:

1. **Choose a unique username**  
   Avoid overly simple usernames (e.g., `coder123`). Instead, combine something personal with a unique twist (e.g., `janedoe.codes` or `jd_XR7`).

2. **Enable two-factor authentication (2FA)**  
   Turn on 2FA for your accounts to add an extra layer of security. Use an app like Google Authenticator or Authy for better protection than SMS.

3. **Review your accounts regularly**  
   Check your account activity and authorized apps, especially on GitHub. Revoke access for apps you no longer use.

4. **Sign your GitHub commits**  
   Signed commits are a great way to prove your identity as a developer. Learn how to set this up: [GitHub guide to signed commits](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits).
